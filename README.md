# Munchkin Game (Text-Scroller Version) by Jared Lee
Welcome to Munchkin, where you play a custom character and fight your way to the top! This is a text-based game based on the original tabletop game "Munchkin". You must fight monsters and level up; reach level 10 and you win! You'll face creatures like scary lawyers to a fierce squidzilla! You'll pick your class, race, and be given starting items. Each class and race will have their own passives, meaning combinations of each will make simultaneous games feel different. You start your journey at level 1 and work your way up, leveling up and obtaining loot after defeating monsters.

To beat monsters, your attack power (your level + any modifiers) must be greater than the monster's level (their level +/- any modifiers). Beating a monster allows you to level up and obtain loot. If your attack power is less than or equal to the monster's level, then bad stuff happens! Of course if you can't beat the monster, you can always attempt to run away. To successfully run away, you must roll a die and get a 4 or higher; otherwise you fail to run away and the bad stuff occurs. The game will end once you reach level 10 or YOU DIE! (so like, don't suck...or be unlucky).
